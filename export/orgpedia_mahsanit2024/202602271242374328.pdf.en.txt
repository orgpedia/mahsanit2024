Introduction - The Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India has released the guidelines for Jal Jeevan FRA Programme dated 25/12/2019. Accordingly, guidelines for implementation of Jal JeevanMIDAN in the state have been issued under the guidelines of the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation dated 4.9.2020.
Under this initiative, Jal Jeevan Mission's main objective is to provide at least 55 litres per capita per day of quality water through individual tap connections to every household in rural areas. The ongoing schemes under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme, the Stand Post Tap Water Supply Scheme, as well as the schemes completed with a minimum of 40 litres per capita per day are being retrofitted to a minimum of 55 litres per capita per day.
The scheme provides tap connections to schools, anganwadis, aided ashramshalas, and government hostels in the state. Solar-based tap water supply schemes are being implemented for isolated / tribal wadis / hamlets.
At present, water is not only a matter of infrastructure in the country, but it is also an important factor deeply rooted in cultural practices, local traditions, livelihoods, and community life. As Jal Jeevan FRM (UM) now moves from a large-scale infrastructure limitation to the next critical phase of planning reliable, regular and safe drinking water, drinking water needs to be incorporated into people's daily lives as a collective responsibility.
