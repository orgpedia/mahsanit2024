The Proposal -
The Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India has released the guidelines for Jal Jeevan FRA Programme dated 25.12.2019. Accordingly, guidelines for implementation of Jal Jeevan FRA in the state have been issued under Government Decision Water Supply and Sanitation Department dated 4.9.2020.
Under this programme, the key focus of Jal Jeevan Midan is to provide quality water supply to every household in rural areas through individual tap connections of at least 55 litres per capita per day. The ongoing schemes under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme, the Stand Post Tap Water Supply Scheme, as well as the schemes completed with a minimum of 40 litres per capita per day are being retrofitted to a minimum of 55 litres per capita per day. The scheme provides tap connections to schools, anganwadis, aided ashramshalas, and government hostels in the state.
Solar-based tap water supply schemes are being implemented for isolated / tribal wadis / hamlets.
A total of 51,560 schemes are being implemented under Jal Jeevan FRA in the state, out of which 26,131 schemes have been completed and the remaining schemes are in various stages of progress. Under this programme, a large number of water supply schemes are currently under progress in the state through Zila Parishad and Maharashtra Jeevan Authority, with some of these schemes being revamped due to technical reasons such as acceptance of higher rates of tenders, increase in Goods and Services Tax, etc.

Proposals for approving budgets are being received at the government level. About 18,036 schemes in the state are being revamped due to leakage of habitations as well as misrepresentation in the UDAH (Source Failure Goods and Services Tax Rate Increase (GST), High Rate Tender, other technical changes and demand from Gram Panchayats, etc.). At present, 11,755 proposals have been received for revised administrative approval at the government level, out of which 7,696 proposals have been given revised administrative approval at the government level. Out of the total proposals under process for revised administrative approvals, about 6679 proposals have been awarded at the cost of original administrative approvals amounting to Rs. The limit up to 50.00 target is increasing and is under process.
A Sub-Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Divisional Commissioner, Nashik to study the existing structure of the Revenue Department and suggest reforms in it has been recommended to confer administrative / financial powers of the Government on the Divisional Commissioners (to increase the financial limits for setting up Jal Jeevan Peart / Rural Water Supply Schemes and other matters). Also, with a view to expedite the process of grant of revised administrative approvals to schemes under Jal Jeevan Mission Scheme, the State Apex Committee of State Water and Sanitation Missions has been constituted. In a meeting held under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary dated 19.01.2026, the original administrative sanction price was fixed at Rs. Schemes with an increase in the limit up to 50.00 target have been directed to be empowered to grant revised administrative approvals at the Divisional Commissioner level. Accordingly, the original administrative sanction price of rural water supply schemes under Jal Jeevan FARA programme is Rs. It was under the consideration of the government to provide the Divisional Commissioner with the power to grant revised administrative approvals to schemes with an increase in the limit up to 50.00 target.
